# Stack and Queue Operations in Python

This Python script demonstrates basic operations using Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) data structures.

## Tasks Covered

### Task 1: Stack Operations (LIFO)

A Stack (Last-In, First-Out) is simulated using a Python list:

- Elements are pushed onto the stack using `append()`.
- The last element is popped using `pop()` to simulate an "undo" operation.
- The final state of the stack is displayed.


### Task 2: Queue Operations (FIFO)

A Queue (First-In, First-Out) is simulated using `collections.deque`:

- Seven citizens are enqueued using `append()`.
- Three citizens are served (dequeued) using `popleft()`.
- The next citizen in line is displayed using indexing.


## Concepts Demonstrated

- Stack (LIFO) behavior
- Queue (FIFO) behavior
- Use of Python's built-in `list` and `collections.deque`
- Basic input/output with `print()`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required beyond Python’s standard library.

## How to Run

1. Save the script to a file, for example: `stack_queue_demo.py`
2. Run the file using Python:
