## Stack Reflection
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means the last element added is the first one to be removed. This is useful in scenarios like undo operations, where the most recent action should be reversed first. In the MoMo and UR examples, the stack allows us to easily remove the most recent step or note, reflecting real-life situations where the latest action is often the one we want to undo or revisit.

## Queue Reflection
FIFO is a simple but powerful principle that helps academic institutions remain fair, efficient, and student-centered. By ensuring that everyone is served in the order they arrive, FIFO upholds core academic values of equity, trust, and respect.
